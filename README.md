# HealthCare-Analytics-Prediction-of-Parkinson-s-disease
Prior prediction of Parkinson's Disease using biomedical voice component . Created a machine learning model using XG-boost Algorithm .With the help of data visualization  to visualize the pattern  and preprocessing the data of this disease with no cure.
Our main objective were
1.	To apply feature selection techniques in order to improve the performance.
2.	To improve the performance by using multicollinearity.
3.	To improve detection rate of Parkinson Disease.

In this we were able to implement the above objectives successfully and improve the accuracy rate of the disease detection
